## Code Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow project's existing patterns
- Match import style and naming conventions
- Single responsibility per function/class
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

### Testing
- Test all public functions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Mock external dependencies
- Target 80%+ coverage

### Error Handling
- Proper try-catch blocks
- Clear error messages
- Graceful degradation
- Don't expose sensitive info

## Core Principles

**Incremental Progress**:
- Small, testable changes
- Commit working code frequently
- Build on previous work (subtasks)

**Evidence-Based**:
- Study 3+ similar patterns before implementing
- Match project style exactly
- Verify with existing code

**Pragmatic**:
- Boring solutions over clever code
- Simple over complex
- Adapt to project reality

**Context Continuity** (Multi-Task):
- Leverage resume for consistency
- Maintain established patterns
- Test integration between subtasks
