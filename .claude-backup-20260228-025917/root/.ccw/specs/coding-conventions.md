# Coding Conventions

## Naming

- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

## Formatting

- 2-space indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas in multi-line constructs

## Patterns

- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Keep functions under 30 lines when practical

## Error Handling

- Always handle errors explicitly
- Prefer typed errors over generic catch-all
- Log errors with sufficient context
