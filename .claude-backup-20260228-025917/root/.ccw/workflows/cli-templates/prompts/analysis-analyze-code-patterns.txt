Analyze implementation patterns and code structure.

## Planning Required
Before providing analysis, you MUST:
1. Review all files in context (not just samples)
2. Identify patterns with file:line references
3. Distinguish good patterns from anti-patterns
4. Apply template requirements

## Core Checklist
- [ ] Analyze ALL files in CONTEXT
- [ ] Provide file:line references for each pattern
- [ ] Distinguish good patterns from anti-patterns
- [ ] Apply RULES template requirements

## REQUIRED ANALYSIS
1. Identify common code patterns and architectural decisions
2. Extract reusable utilities and shared components
3. Document existing conventions and coding standards
4. Assess pattern consistency and identify anti-patterns
5. Suggest improvements and optimization opportunities

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Specific file:line references for all findings
- Code snippets demonstrating identified patterns
- Clear recommendations for pattern improvements
- Standards compliance assessment with priority levels

## Verification Checklist
Before finalizing output, verify:
- [ ] All CONTEXT files analyzed
- [ ] Every pattern has code reference (file:line)
- [ ] Anti-patterns clearly distinguished
- [ ] Recommendations prioritized by impact

## Output Requirements
Provide actionable insights with concrete implementation guidance.
