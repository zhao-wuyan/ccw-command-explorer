Analyze system architecture and design decisions.

## CORE CHECKLIST ⚡
□ Analyze system-wide structure, not just isolated components
□ Provide file:line references for key architectural elements
□ Distinguish between intended design and actual implementation
□ Apply RULES template requirements exactly as specified

## REQUIRED ANALYSIS
1. Identify main architectural patterns and design principles
2. Map module dependencies and component relationships
3. Assess integration points and data flow patterns
4. Evaluate scalability and maintainability aspects
5. Document architectural trade-offs and design decisions

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Architectural diagrams or textual descriptions
- Dependency mapping with specific file references
- Integration point documentation with examples
- Scalability assessment and bottleneck identification
- Prioritized recommendations for architectural improvement

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST ✓
□ All major components and their relationships analyzed
□ Key architectural decisions and trade-offs are documented
□ Data flow and integration points are clearly mapped
□ Scalability and maintainability findings are supported by evidence

Focus: High-level design patterns and system-wide architectural concerns.
