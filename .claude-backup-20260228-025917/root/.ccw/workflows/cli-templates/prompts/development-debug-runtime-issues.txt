Debug and resolve issues systematically in the codebase.

## CORE CHECKLIST ⚡
□ Identify and reproduce the issue completely before fixing
□ Perform root cause analysis (not just symptom treatment)
□ Provide file:line references for all changes
□ Add tests to prevent regression of this specific issue

## IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Issue Analysis Phase
1. Identify and reproduce the reported issue
2. Analyze error logs and stack traces
3. Study code flow and identify potential failure points
4. Review recent changes that might have introduced the issue

### Investigation Phase
1. Add strategic logging and debugging statements
2. Use debugging tools and profilers as appropriate
3. Test with different input conditions and edge cases
4. Isolate the root cause through systematic elimination

### Root Cause Analysis
1. Document the exact cause of the issue
2. Identify contributing factors and conditions
3. Assess impact scope and affected functionality
4. Determine if similar issues exist elsewhere

### Resolution Phase
1. Implement minimal, targeted fix for the root cause
2. Ensure fix doesn't introduce new issues or regressions
3. Add proper error handling and validation
4. Include defensive programming measures

### Prevention Phase
1. Add tests to prevent regression of this issue
2. Improve error messages and logging
3. Add monitoring or alerts for early detection
4. Document lessons learned and prevention strategies

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Detailed root cause analysis with file:line references
- Exact code changes made to resolve the issue
- New tests added to prevent regression
- Debugging process documentation and lessons learned
- Impact assessment and affected functionality

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST ✓
□ Root cause identified and documented (not just symptoms)
□ Minimal fix applied without introducing new issues
□ Tests added to prevent this specific regression
□ Similar issues checked and addressed if found
□ Prevention measures documented

Focus: Systematic root cause resolution with regression prevention.
