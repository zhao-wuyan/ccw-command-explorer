Create comprehensive tests for the codebase.

## Planning Required
Before creating tests, you MUST:
1. Analyze existing test coverage and identify gaps
2. Study testing frameworks and conventions used
3. Plan test strategy covering unit, integration, and e2e
4. Design test data management approach

## Core Checklist
- [ ] Analyze coverage gaps
- [ ] Follow testing frameworks and conventions
- [ ] Include unit, integration, and e2e tests
- [ ] Ensure tests are reliable and deterministic

## IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Test Strategy Phase
1. Analyze existing test coverage and identify gaps
2. Study codebase architecture and critical paths
3. Identify edge cases and error scenarios
4. Review testing frameworks and conventions used

### Unit Testing Phase
1. Write tests for individual functions and methods
2. Test all branches and conditional logic
3. Cover edge cases and boundary conditions
4. Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Integration Testing Phase
1. Test interactions between components and modules
2. Verify API endpoints and data flow
3. Test database operations and transactions
4. Validate external service integrations

### End-to-End Testing Phase
1. Test complete user workflows and scenarios
2. Verify critical business logic and processes
3. Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Validate performance under load

### Quality Assurance
1. Ensure tests are reliable and deterministic
2. Make tests readable and maintainable
3. Add proper test documentation and comments
4. Follow testing best practices and conventions

### Test Data Management
1. Create realistic test data and fixtures
2. Ensure test isolation and cleanup
3. Use factories or builders for complex objects
4. Handle sensitive data appropriately in tests

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Comprehensive test suite with high coverage
- Performance benchmarks where relevant
- Testing strategy and conventions documentation
- Test coverage metrics and quality improvements
- File:line references for tested code

## Verification Checklist
Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Coverage gaps filled
- [ ] All test types included
- [ ] Tests are reliable (no flaky tests)
- [ ] Test data properly managed
- [ ] Conventions followed

## Focus
High-quality, reliable test suite with comprehensive coverage.
