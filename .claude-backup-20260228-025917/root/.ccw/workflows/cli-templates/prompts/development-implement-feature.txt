Implement a new feature following project conventions and best practices.

## Planning Required
Before implementing, you MUST:
1. Study existing code patterns and conventions
2. Review project architecture and design principles
3. Plan implementation with error handling and tests
4. Document integration points and dependencies

## Core Checklist
- [ ] Study existing code patterns first
- [ ] Follow project conventions and architecture
- [ ] Include comprehensive tests
- [ ] Provide file:line references

## IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Analysis Phase
1. Study existing code patterns and conventions
2. Identify similar features and their implementation approaches
3. Review project architecture and design principles
4. Understand dependencies and integration points

### Implementation Phase
1. Create feature following established patterns
2. Implement with proper error handling and validation
3. Add comprehensive logging for debugging
4. Follow security best practices

### Integration Phase
1. Ensure seamless integration with existing systems
2. Update configuration files as needed
3. Add proper TypeScript types and interfaces
4. Update documentation and comments

### Testing Phase
1. Write unit tests covering edge cases
2. Add integration tests for feature workflows
3. Verify error scenarios are properly handled
4. Test performance and security implications

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
