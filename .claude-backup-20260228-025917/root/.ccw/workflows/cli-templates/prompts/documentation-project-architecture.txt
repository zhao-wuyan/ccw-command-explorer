Generate comprehensive architecture documentation for the entire project.

## CORE CHECKLIST ⚡
□ Synthesize information from all modules; do not duplicate content
□ Maintain a system-level perspective, focusing on module interactions
□ Use visual aids (like ASCII diagrams) to clarify structure
□ Explain the WHY behind architectural decisions

## DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE
