Plan system migration and modernization strategies.

## CORE CHECKLIST ⚡
□ Assess current system completely before planning migration
□ Plan incremental migration (avoid big-bang approach)
□ Include rollback plan for every migration step
□ Provide file:line references for all affected code

## REQUIRED ANALYSIS
1. Assess current system architecture and migration requirements
2. Identify migration paths and transformation strategies
3. Plan data migration and system cutover procedures
4. Evaluate compatibility and integration challenges
5. Document rollback plans and risk mitigation strategies

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Migration strategy with step-by-step execution plan
- Data migration procedures and validation checkpoints
- Compatibility assessment with file:line references
- Risk analysis and rollback procedures for each phase
- Testing strategy for migration validation

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST ✓
□ Migration planned in incremental phases (not big-bang)
□ Every phase has rollback plan documented
□ Data migration validated with checkpoints
□ Compatibility issues identified and mitigated
□ Testing strategy covers all migration phases

Focus: Low-risk incremental migration with comprehensive fallback options.
