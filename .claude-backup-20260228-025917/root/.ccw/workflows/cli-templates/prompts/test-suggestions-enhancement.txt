PURPOSE: Generate comprehensive multi-layer test enhancement suggestions
  - Success: Cover L0-L3 layers with focus on API, integration, and error scenarios
  - Scope: Files with coverage gaps identified in TEST_ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md
  - Goal: Provide specific, actionable test case suggestions that increase coverage completeness

TASK:
  • L1 (Unit Tests): Suggest edge cases, boundary conditions, error paths, state transitions
  • L2.1 (Integration): Suggest module interaction patterns, dependency injection scenarios
  • L2.2 (API Contracts): Suggest request/response test cases, validation, status codes, error responses
  • L2.4 (External APIs): Suggest mock strategies, failure scenarios, timeout handling, retry logic
  • L2.5 (Failure Modes): Suggest exception hierarchies, error propagation, recovery strategies
  • Cross-cutting: Suggest performance test cases, security considerations

MODE: analysis

CONTEXT: @.workflow/active/{test-session-id}/.process/TEST_ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md
  Memory: Project type, test framework, existing test patterns, coverage gaps

EXPECTED: Markdown report with structured test enhancement suggestions organized by:
  1. File-level test requirements (per file needing tests)
  2. Layer-specific test cases (L1, L2.1, L2.2, L2.4, L2.5)
  3. Each suggestion includes:
     - Test type and layer (e.g., "L2.2 API Contract Test")
     - Specific test case description (e.g., "POST /api/users - Invalid email format")
     - Expected behavior (e.g., "Returns 400 with validation error message")
     - Dependencies/mocks needed (e.g., "Mock email service")
     - Success criteria (e.g., "Status 400, error.field === 'email'")
  4. Test ordering/dependencies (which tests should run first)
  5. Integration test strategies (how components interact)
  6. Error scenario matrix (all failure modes covered)

CONSTRAINTS:
  - Focus on identified coverage gaps from TEST_ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md
  - Prioritize API tests, integration tests, and error scenarios
  - No code generation - suggestions only with sufficient detail for implementation
  - Consider project conventions and existing test patterns
  - Each suggestion should be actionable and specific (not generic)
  - Output format: Markdown with clear section headers
