Assess the technical feasibility of a workflow implementation plan.

## CORE CHECKLIST ⚡
□ Evaluate implementation complexity and required skills
□ Validate all technical dependencies and prerequisites
□ Assess the proposed code structure and integration patterns
□ Verify the completeness of the testing strategy

## REQUIRED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
1. **Implementation Complexity**: Evaluate code difficulty and required skills.
2. **Technical Dependencies**: Review libraries, versions, and build systems.
3. **Code Structure**: Assess file organization, naming, and modularity.
4. **Testing Completeness**: Evaluate test coverage, types, and gaps.
5. **Execution Readiness**: Validate control flow, context, and file targets.

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- **Technical Assessment Report**: Grades for implementation, complexity, and quality.
- **Detailed Technical Findings**: Blocking issues, performance concerns, and improvements.
- **Implementation Recommendations**: Prerequisites, best practices, and refactoring.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Technical, dependency, integration, and quality risks.
