## VALIDATION METHODOLOGY

### Complexity Scoring
Rate each aspect on 1-5 scale:
- Technical Complexity
- Integration Complexity
- Performance Risk
- Security Risk
- Maintenance Burden

### Risk Classification
- **LOW**: Minor issues, easily addressable
- **MEDIUM**: Manageable challenges with clear mitigation
- **HIGH**: Significant concerns requiring major mitigation
- **CRITICAL**: Fundamental viability threats

### Feasibility Judgment
- **PROCEED**: Technically feasible with acceptable risk
- **PROCEED_WITH_MODIFICATIONS**: Feasible but needs adjustments
- **RECONSIDER**: High risk, major changes needed
- **REJECT**: Not feasible with current approach

## CONTEXT INTEGRATION
