- **How**: Extract requirements, architecture decisions, UI/UX patterns from applicable role documents
- **Priority**: Collective authoritative source - multiple role perspectives provide comprehensive coverage
- **CCW Value**: Maintains role-specific expertise while enabling cross-role integration during planning

**Context Intelligence (context-package.json)**:
- **What**: Smart context gathered by CCW's context-gather phase
- **Content**: Focus paths, dependency graph, existing patterns, module structure
- **Usage**: Tasks load this via `flow_control.preparatory_steps` for environment setup
- **CCW Value**: Automated intelligent context discovery replacing manual file exploration

**Technical Analysis (ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md)**:
- **What**: Gemini/Qwen/Codex parallel analysis results
- **Content**: Optimization strategies, risk assessment, architecture review, implementation patterns
- **Usage**: Referenced in task planning for technical guidance and risk mitigation
- **CCW Value**: Multi-model parallel analysis providing comprehensive technical intelligence
