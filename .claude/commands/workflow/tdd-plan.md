# TDD Workflow Plan Command (/workflow:tdd-plan)

## Coordinator Role

**This command is a pure orchestrator**: Executes 6 slash commands in sequence, parse outputs, pass context, and ensure complete TDD workflow creation with Red-Green-Refactor task generation.

**CLI Tool Selection**: CLI tool usage is determined semantically from user's task description. Include "use Codex/Gemini/Qwen" in your request for CLI execution.

**Task Attachment Model**:
- SlashCommand execute **expands workflow** by attaching sub-tasks to current TodoWrite
- When executing a sub-command (e.g., `/workflow:tools:test-context-gather`), its internal tasks are attached to the orchestrator's TodoWrite
- Orchestrator **executes these attached tasks** sequentially
- After completion, attached tasks are **collapsed** back to high-level phase summary
- This is **task expansion**, not external delegation

**Auto-Continue Mechanism**:
- TodoList tracks current phase status and dynamically manages task attachment/collapse
- When each phase finishes executing, automatically execute next pending phase
- All phases run autonomously without user interaction
- **⚠️ CONTINUOUS EXECUTION** - Do not stop until all phases complete

## Core Rules

1. **Start Immediately**: First action is TodoWrite initialization, second action is execute Phase 1
2. **No Preliminary Analysis**: Do not read files before Phase 1
3. **Parse Every Output**: Extract required data for next phase
4. **Auto-Continue via TodoList**: Check TodoList status to execute next pending phase automatically
5. **Track Progress**: Update TodoWrite dynamically with task attachment/collapse pattern
6. **TDD Context**: All descriptions include "TDD:" prefix
7. **Task Attachment Model**: SlashCommand execute **attaches** sub-tasks to current workflow. Orchestrator **executes** these attached tasks itself, then **collapses** them after completion
8. **⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT STOP**: Continuous multi-phase workflow. After executing all attached tasks, immediately collapse them and execute next phase

## TDD Compliance Requirements

### The Iron Law

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

**Enforcement Method**:
- Phase 5: `implementation_approach` includes test-first steps (Red → Green → Refactor)
- Green phase: Includes test-fix-cycle configuration (max 3 iterations)
- Auto-revert: Triggered when max iterations reached without passing tests

**Verification**: Phase 6 validates Red-Green-Refactor structure in all generated tasks

### TDD Compliance Checkpoint

| Checkpoint | Validation Phase | Evidence Required |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Test-first structure | Phase 5 | `implementation_approach` has 3 steps |
| Red phase exists | Phase 6 | Step 1: `tdd_phase: "red"` |
| Green phase with test-fix | Phase 6 | Step 2: `tdd_phase: "green"` + test-fix-cycle |
| Refactor phase exists | Phase 6 | Step 3: `tdd_phase: "refactor"` |

### Core TDD Principles (from ref skills)

**Red Flags - STOP and Reassess**:
- Code written before test
- Test passes immediately (no Red phase witnessed)
- Cannot explain why test should fail
- "Just this once" rationalization
- "Tests after achieve same goals" thinking

**Why Order Matters**:
- Tests written after code pass immediately → proves nothing
- Test-first forces edge case discovery before implementation
- Tests-after verify what was built, not what's required

## 6-Phase Execution (with Conflict Resolution)

### Phase 1: Session Discovery

**Step 1.1: Execute** - Session discovery and initialization

```javascript
SlashCommand(command="/workflow:session:start --type tdd --auto \"TDD: [structured-description]\"")
```

**TDD Structured Format**:
```
TDD: [Feature Name]
GOAL: [Objective]
SCOPE: [Included/excluded]
CONTEXT: [Background]
TEST_FOCUS: [Test scenarios]
```

**Parse**: Extract sessionId

**TodoWrite**: Mark phase 1 completed, phase 2 in_progress

**After Phase 1**: Return to user showing Phase 1 results, then auto-continue to Phase 2

---

### Phase 2: Context Gathering

**Step 2.1: Execute** - Context gathering and analysis

```javascript
SlashCommand(command="/workflow:tools:context-gather --session [sessionId] \"TDD: [structured-description]\"")
```

**Use Same Structured Description**: Pass the same structured format from Phase 1

**Input**: `sessionId` from Phase 1

**Parse Output**:
- Extract: context-package.json path (store as `contextPath`)
- Typical pattern: `.workflow/active/[sessionId]/.process/context-package.json`

**Validation**:
- Context package path extracted
- File exists and is valid JSON

**TodoWrite**: Mark phase 2 completed, phase 3 in_progress

**After Phase 2**: Return to user showing Phase 2 results, then auto-continue to Phase 3

---

### Phase 3: Test Coverage Analysis

**Step 3.1: Execute** - Test coverage analysis and framework detection

```javascript
SlashCommand(command="/workflow:tools:test-context-gather --session [sessionId]")
```

**Purpose**: Analyze existing codebase for:
- Existing test patterns and conventions
- Current test coverage
- Related components and integration points
- Test framework detection

**Parse**: Extract testContextPath (`.workflow/active/[sessionId]/.process/test-context-package.json`)



<!-- TodoWrite: When test-context-gather executed, INSERT 3 test-context-gather tasks -->

**TodoWrite Update (Phase 3 SlashCommand executed - tasks attached)**:
```json
[
  {"content": "Phase 1: Session Discovery", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing session discovery"},
  {"content": "Phase 2: Context Gathering", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing context gathering"},
  {"content": "Phase 3: Test Coverage Analysis", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Executing test coverage analysis"},
  {"content": "  → Detect test framework and conventions", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Detecting test framework"},
  {"content": "  → Analyze existing test coverage", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Analyzing test coverage"},

  {"content": "Phase 6: TDD Structure Validation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating TDD structure"}
]
```

**Note**: SlashCommand execute **attaches** test-context-gather's 3 tasks. Orchestrator **executes** these tasks.

**Next Action**: Tasks attached → **Execute Phase 3.1-3.3** sequentially

<!-- TodoWrite: After Phase 3 tasks complete, REMOVE Phase 3.1-3.3, restore to orchestrator view -->

**TodoWrite Update (Phase 3 completed - tasks collapsed)**:
```json
[
  {"content": "Phase 1: Session Discovery", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing session discovery"},
  {"content": "Phase 2: Context Gathering", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing context gathering"},
  {"content": "Phase 3: Test Coverage Analysis", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing test coverage analysis"},
  {"content": "Phase 5: TDD Task Generation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Executing TDD task generation"},
  {"content": "Phase 6: TDD Structure Validation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating TDD structure"}
]
```

**Note**: Phase 3 tasks completed and collapsed to summary.

**After Phase 3**: Return to user showing test coverage results, then auto-continue to Phase 4/5 (depending on conflict_risk)

---

### Phase 4: Conflict Resolution (Optional - auto-triggered by conflict risk)

**Trigger**: Only execute when context-package.json indicates conflict_risk is "medium" or "high"

**Step 4.1: Execute** - Conflict detection and resolution

```javascript
SlashCommand(command="/workflow:tools:conflict-resolution --session [sessionId] --context [contextPath]")
```

**Input**:
- sessionId from Phase 1
- contextPath from Phase 2
- conflict_risk from context-package.json

**Parse Output**:
- Extract: Execution status (success/skipped/failed)
- Verify: conflict-resolution.json file path (if executed)

**Validation**:
- File `.workflow/active/[sessionId]/.process/conflict-resolution.json` exists (if executed)

**Skip Behavior**:
- If conflict_risk is "none" or "low", skip directly to Phase 5
- Display: "No significant conflicts detected, proceeding to TDD task generation"

<!-- TodoWrite: If conflict_risk ≥ medium, INSERT 3 conflict-resolution tasks when executed -->

**TodoWrite Update (Phase 4 SlashCommand executed - tasks attached, if conflict_risk ≥ medium)**:
```json
[
  {"content": "Phase 1: Session Discovery", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing session discovery"},
  {"content": "Phase 2: Context Gathering", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing context gathering"},
  {"content": "Phase 3: Test Coverage Analysis", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing test coverage analysis"},
  {"content": "Phase 4: Conflict Resolution", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Executing conflict resolution"},
  {"content": "  → Detect conflicts with CLI analysis", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Detecting conflicts"},
  {"content": "  → Log and analyze detected conflicts", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Analyzing conflicts"},
  {"content": "  → Apply resolution strategies", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Applying resolution strategies"},
  {"content": "Phase 5: TDD Task Generation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Executing TDD task generation"},
  {"content": "Phase 6: TDD Structure Validation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating TDD structure"}
]
```

**Note**: SlashCommand execute **attaches** conflict-resolution's 3 tasks. Orchestrator **executes** these tasks.

**Next Action**: Tasks attached → **Execute Phase 4.1-4.3** sequentially

<!-- TodoWrite: After Phase 4 tasks complete, REMOVE Phase 4.1-4.3, restore to orchestrator view -->

**TodoWrite Update (Phase 4 completed - tasks collapsed)**:
```json
[
  {"content": "Phase 1: Session Discovery", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing session discovery"},
  {"content": "Phase 2: Context Gathering", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing context gathering"},
  {"content": "Phase 3: Test Coverage Analysis", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing test coverage analysis"},
  {"content": "Phase 4: Conflict Resolution", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing conflict resolution"},
  {"content": "Phase 5: TDD Task Generation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Executing TDD task generation"},
  {"content": "Phase 6: TDD Structure Validation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating TDD structure"}
]
```

**Note**: Phase 4 tasks completed and collapsed to summary.

**After Phase 4**: Return to user showing conflict resolution results (if executed) and selected strategies, then auto-continue to Phase 5

**Memory State Check**:
- Evaluate current context window usage and memory state
- If memory usage is high (>110K tokens or approaching context limits):

  **Step 4.5: Execute** - Memory compaction

  ```javascript
  SlashCommand(command="/compact")
  ```

  - This optimizes memory before proceeding to Phase 5
- Memory compaction is particularly important after analysis phase which may generate extensive documentation
- Ensures optimal performance and prevents context overflow

---

### Phase 5: TDD Task Generation

**Step 5.1: Execute** - TDD task generation via action-planning-agent with Phase 0 user configuration

```javascript
SlashCommand(command="/workflow:tools:task-generate-tdd --session [sessionId]")
```

**Note**: Phase 0 now includes:
- Supplementary materials collection (file paths or inline content)
- Execution method preference (Agent/Hybrid/CLI)
- CLI tool preference (Codex/Gemini/Qwen/Auto)
- These preferences are passed to agent for task generation

**Parse**: Extract feature count, task count (not chain count - tasks now contain internal TDD cycles), CLI execution IDs assigned

**Validate**:
- IMPL_PLAN.md exists (unified plan with TDD Implementation Tasks section)
- IMPL-*.json files exist (one per feature, or container + subtasks for complex features)
- TODO_LIST.md exists with internal TDD phase indicators
- Each IMPL task includes:
  - `meta.tdd_workflow: true`
  - `meta.cli_execution_id: {session_id}-{task_id}`
  - `meta.cli_execution: { "strategy": "new|resume|fork|merge_fork", ... }`
  - `flow_control.implementation_approach` with exactly 3 steps (red/green/refactor)
  - Green phase includes test-fix-cycle configuration
  - `context.focus_paths`: absolute or clear relative paths (enhanced with exploration critical_files)
  - `flow_control.pre_analysis`: includes exploration integration_points analysis
- IMPL_PLAN.md contains workflow_type: "tdd" in frontmatter
- User configuration applied:
  - If executionMethod == "cli" or "hybrid": command field added to steps
  - CLI tool preference reflected in execution guidance
- Task count ≤18 (compliance with hard limit)

**Red Flag Detection** (Non-Blocking Warnings):
- Task count >18: `⚠️ Task count exceeds hard limit - request re-scope`
- Missing cli_execution_id: `⚠️ Task lacks CLI execution ID for resume support`
- Missing test-fix-cycle: `⚠️ Green phase lacks auto-revert configuration`
- Generic task names: `⚠️ Vague task names suggest unclear TDD cycles`
- Missing focus_paths: `⚠️ Task lacks clear file scope for implementation`

**Action**: Log warnings to `.workflow/active/[sessionId]/.process/tdd-warnings.log` (non-blocking)

<!-- TodoWrite: When task-generate-tdd executed, INSERT 3 task-generate-tdd tasks -->

**TodoWrite Update (Phase 5 SlashCommand executed - tasks attached)**:
```json
[
  {"content": "Phase 1: Session Discovery", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing session discovery"},
  {"content": "Phase 2: Context Gathering", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing context gathering"},
  {"content": "Phase 3: Test Coverage Analysis", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing test coverage analysis"},
  {"content": "Phase 5: TDD Task Generation", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Executing TDD task generation"},
  {"content": "  → Discovery - analyze TDD requirements", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Analyzing TDD requirements"},
  {"content": "  → Planning - design Red-Green-Refactor cycles", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Designing TDD cycles"},
  {"content": "  → Output - generate IMPL tasks with internal TDD phases", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Generating TDD tasks"},
  {"content": "Phase 6: TDD Structure Validation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating TDD structure"}
]
```

**Note**: SlashCommand execute **attaches** task-generate-tdd's 3 tasks. Orchestrator **executes** these tasks. Each generated IMPL task will contain internal Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

**Next Action**: Tasks attached → **Execute Phase 5.1-5.3** sequentially

<!-- TodoWrite: After Phase 5 tasks complete, REMOVE Phase 5.1-5.3, restore to orchestrator view -->

**TodoWrite Update (Phase 5 completed - tasks collapsed)**:
```json
[
  {"content": "Phase 1: Session Discovery", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing session discovery"},
  {"content": "Phase 2: Context Gathering", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing context gathering"},
  {"content": "Phase 3: Test Coverage Analysis", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing test coverage analysis"},
  {"content": "Phase 5: TDD Task Generation", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing TDD task generation"},
  {"content": "Phase 6: TDD Structure Validation", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Validating TDD structure"}
]
```

**Note**: Phase 5 tasks completed and collapsed to summary. Each generated IMPL task contains complete Red-Green-Refactor cycle internally.

### Phase 6: TDD Structure Validation & Action Plan Verification (RECOMMENDED)
**Internal validation first, then recommend external verification**

**Internal Validation**:
1. Each task contains complete TDD workflow (Red-Green-Refactor internally)
2. Task structure validation:
   - `meta.tdd_workflow: true` in all IMPL tasks
   - `meta.cli_execution_id` present (format: {session_id}-{task_id})
   - `meta.cli_execution` strategy assigned (new/resume/fork/merge_fork)
   - `flow_control.implementation_approach` has exactly 3 steps
   - Each step has correct `tdd_phase`: "red", "green", "refactor"
   - `context.focus_paths` are absolute or clear relative paths
   - `flow_control.pre_analysis` includes exploration integration analysis
3. Dependency validation:
   - Sequential features: IMPL-N depends_on ["IMPL-(N-1)"] if needed
   - Complex features: IMPL-N.M depends_on ["IMPL-N.(M-1)"] for subtasks
   - CLI execution strategies correctly assigned based on dependency graph
4. Agent assignment: All IMPL tasks use @code-developer
5. Test-fix cycle: Green phase step includes test-fix-cycle logic with max_iterations
6. Task count: Total tasks ≤18 (simple + subtasks hard limit)
7. User configuration:
   - Execution method choice reflected in task structure
   - CLI tool preference documented in implementation guidance (if CLI selected)

**Red Flag Checklist** (from TDD best practices):
- [ ] No tasks skip Red phase (`tdd_phase: "red"` exists in step 1)
- [ ] Test files referenced in Red phase (explicit paths, not placeholders)
- [ ] Green phase has test-fix-cycle with `max_iterations` configured
- [ ] Refactor phase has clear completion criteria

**Non-Compliance Warning Format**:
```
⚠️ TDD Red Flag: [issue description]
   Task: [IMPL-N]
   Recommendation: [action to fix]
```

**Evidence Gathering** (Before Completion Claims):

```bash
# Verify session artifacts exist
ls -la .workflow/active/[sessionId]/{IMPL_PLAN.md,TODO_LIST.md}
ls -la .workflow/active/[sessionId]/.task/IMPL-*.json

# Count generated artifacts
echo "IMPL tasks: $(ls .workflow/active/[sessionId]/.task/IMPL-*.json 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"

# Sample task structure verification (first task)
jq '{id, tdd: .meta.tdd_workflow, cli_id: .meta.cli_execution_id, phases: [.flow_control.implementation_approach[].tdd_phase]}' \
  "$(ls .workflow/active/[sessionId]/.task/IMPL-*.json | head -1)"
```

**Evidence Required Before Summary**:
| Evidence Type | Verification Method | Pass Criteria |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| File existence | `ls -la` artifacts | All files present |
| Task count | Count IMPL-*.json | Count matches claims (≤18) |
| TDD structure | jq sample extraction | Shows red/green/refactor + cli_execution_id |
| CLI execution IDs | jq extraction | All tasks have cli_execution_id assigned |
| Warning log | Check tdd-warnings.log | Logged (may be empty) |

**Return Summary**:
```
TDD Planning complete for session: [sessionId]

Features analyzed: [N]
Total tasks: [M] (1 task per simple feature + subtasks for complex features)

Task breakdown:
- Simple features: [K] tasks (IMPL-1 to IMPL-K)
- Complex features: [L] features with [P] subtasks
- Total task count: [M] (within 18-task hard limit)

Structure:
- IMPL-1: {Feature 1 Name} (Internal: Red → Green → Refactor)
- IMPL-2: {Feature 2 Name} (Internal: Red → Green → Refactor)
- IMPL-3: {Complex Feature} (Container)
  - IMPL-3.1: {Sub-feature A} (Internal: Red → Green → Refactor)
  - IMPL-3.2: {Sub-feature B} (Internal: Red → Green → Refactor)
[...]

Plans generated:
- Unified Implementation Plan: .workflow/active/[sessionId]/IMPL_PLAN.md
  (includes TDD Implementation Tasks section with workflow_type: "tdd")
- Task List: .workflow/active/[sessionId]/TODO_LIST.md
  (with internal TDD phase indicators and CLI execution strategies)
- Task JSONs: .workflow/active/[sessionId]/.task/IMPL-*.json
  (with cli_execution_id and execution strategies for resume support)

TDD Configuration:
- Each task contains complete Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Green phase includes test-fix cycle (max 3 iterations)
- Auto-revert on max iterations reached
- CLI execution strategies: new/resume/fork/merge_fork based on dependency graph

User Configuration Applied:
- Execution Method: [agent|hybrid|cli]
- CLI Tool Preference: [codex|gemini|qwen|auto]
- Supplementary Materials: [included|none]
- Task generation follows cli-tools-usage.md guidelines

⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Before execution, ensure you understand WHY each Red phase test is expected to fail.
   This is crucial for valid TDD - if you don't know why the test fails, you can't verify it tests the right thing.

Recommended Next Steps:
1. /workflow:plan-verify --session [sessionId]  # Verify TDD plan quality and dependencies
2. /workflow:execute --session [sessionId]  # Start TDD execution with CLI strategies
3. /workflow:tdd-verify [sessionId]  # Post-execution TDD compliance check

Quality Gate: Consider running /workflow:plan-verify to validate TDD task structure, dependencies, and CLI execution strategies
```

## TodoWrite Pattern

**Core Concept**: Dynamic task attachment and collapse for TDD workflow with test coverage analysis and Red-Green-Refactor cycle generation.

### Key Principles

1. **Task Attachment** (when SlashCommand executed):
   - Sub-command's internal tasks are **attached** to orchestrator's TodoWrite
   - Example: `/workflow:tools:test-context-gather` attaches 3 sub-tasks (Phase 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)
   - First attached task marked as `in_progress`, others as `pending`
   - Orchestrator **executes** these attached tasks sequentially

2. **Task Collapse** (after sub-tasks complete):
   - Remove detailed sub-tasks from TodoWrite
   - **Collapse** to high-level phase summary
   - Example: Phase 3.1-3.3 collapse to "Execute test coverage analysis: completed"
   - Maintains clean orchestrator-level view

3. **Continuous Execution**:
   - After collapse, automatically proceed to next pending phase
   - No user intervention required between phases
   - TodoWrite dynamically reflects current execution state

**Lifecycle Summary**: Initial pending tasks → Phase executed (tasks ATTACHED) → Sub-tasks executed sequentially → Phase completed (tasks COLLAPSED to summary) → Next phase begins (conditional Phase 4 if conflict_risk ≥ medium) → Repeat until all phases complete.

### TDD-Specific Features

- **Phase 3**: Test coverage analysis detects existing patterns and gaps
- **Phase 5**: Generated IMPL tasks contain internal Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- **Conditional Phase 4**: Conflict resolution only if conflict_risk ≥ medium



**Note**: See individual Phase descriptions (Phase 3, 4, 5) for detailed TodoWrite Update examples with full JSON structures.

Key Points:
• ← ATTACHED: SlashCommand attaches sub-tasks to orchestrator TodoWrite
• ← COLLAPSED: Sub-tasks executed and collapsed to phase summary
• TDD-specific: Each generated IMPL task contains complete Red-Green-Refactor cycle
```

## Input Processing

Convert user input to TDD-structured format:

**Simple text** → Add TDD context
**Detailed text** → Extract components with TEST_FOCUS
**File/Issue** → Read and structure with TDD

## Error Handling

- **Parsing failure**: Retry once, then report
- **Validation failure**: Report missing/invalid data
- **Command failure**: Keep phase in_progress, report error
- **TDD validation failure**: Report incomplete chains or wrong dependencies

### TDD Warning Patterns

| Pattern | Warning Message | Recommended Action |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Task count >10 | High task count detected | Consider splitting into multiple sessions |
| Missing test-fix-cycle | Green phase lacks auto-revert | Add `max_iterations: 3` to task config |
| Red phase missing test path | Test file path not specified | Add explicit test file paths |
| Generic task names | Vague names like "Add feature" | Use specific behavior descriptions |
| No refactor criteria | Refactor phase lacks completion criteria | Define clear refactor scope |

### Non-Blocking Warning Policy

**All warnings are advisory** - they do not halt execution:
1. Warnings logged to `.process/tdd-warnings.log`
2. Summary displayed in Phase 6 output
3. User decides whether to address before `/workflow:execute`

### Error Handling Quick Reference

| Error Type | Detection | Recovery Action |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Parsing failure | Empty/malformed output | Retry once, then report |
| Missing context-package | File read error | Re-run `/workflow:tools:context-gather` |
| Invalid task JSON | jq parse error | Report malformed file path |
| Task count exceeds 18 | Count validation ≥19 | Request re-scope, split into multiple sessions |
| Missing cli_execution_id | All tasks lack ID | Regenerate tasks with phase 0 user config |
| Test-context missing | File not found | Re-run `/workflow:tools:test-context-gather` |
| Phase timeout | No response | Retry phase, check CLI connectivity |
| CLI tool not available | Tool not in cli-tools.json | Fall back to alternative preferred tool |

- `/compact` - Phase 4: Memory optimization (if context approaching limits)
- `/workflow:tools:task-generate-tdd` - Phase 5: Generate TDD tasks (CLI tool usage determined semantically)

**Follow-up Commands**:
- `/workflow:plan-verify` - Recommended: Verify TDD plan quality and structure before execution
- `/workflow:status` - Review TDD task breakdown
- `/workflow:execute` - Begin TDD implementation
- `/workflow:tdd-verify` - Post-execution: Verify TDD compliance and generate quality report

## Next Steps Decision Table

| Situation | Recommended Command | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| First time planning | `/workflow:plan-verify` | Validate task structure before execution |
| Warnings in tdd-warnings.log | Review log, refine tasks | Address Red Flags before proceeding |
| High task count warning | Consider `/workflow:session:start` | Split into focused sub-sessions |
| Ready to implement | `/workflow:execute` | Begin TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycles |
| After implementation | `/workflow:tdd-verify` | Generate TDD compliance report |
| Need to review tasks | `/workflow:status --session [id]` | Inspect current task breakdown |
| Plan needs changes | `/task:replan` | Update task JSON with new requirements |

### TDD Workflow State Transitions

```
/workflow:tdd-plan
        ↓
[Planning Complete] ──→ /workflow:plan-verify (recommended)
        ↓
[Verified/Ready] ─────→ /workflow:execute
        ↓
[Implementation] ─────→ /workflow:tdd-verify (post-execution)
        ↓
[Quality Report] ─────→ Done or iterate
```
