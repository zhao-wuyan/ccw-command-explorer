# Prompt Enhancer

**Transform**: Vague intent → Structured specification (Memory-based, Direct Output)

**Languages**: English + Chinese (中英文语义识别)

## Process (Internal → Direct Output)

**Internal Analysis**: Intelligently extract session context, identify tech stack, and structure into actionable format.

**Output**: Direct structured prompt (no intermediate steps shown)

## Output Format

**Dynamic Structure**: Adapt fields based on task type and context needs. Not all fields are required.

**Core Fields** (always present):
- **INTENT**: One-sentence technical goal
- **ACTION**: Concrete steps with technical details

**Optional Fields** (include when relevant):
- **TECH STACK**: Relevant technologies (when tech-specific)
- **CONTEXT**: Session memory findings (when context matters)
- **ATTENTION**: Critical constraints (when risks/requirements exist)
- **SCOPE**: Affected modules/files (for multi-module tasks)
- **METRICS**: Success criteria (for optimization/performance tasks)
- **DEPENDENCIES**: Related components (for integration tasks)

**Example (Simple Task)**:
```
📋 ENHANCED PROMPT

INTENT: Fix authentication token validation in JWT middleware

ACTION:
1. Review token expiration logic in auth middleware
2. Add proper error handling for expired tokens
3. Test with valid/expired/malformed tokens
```

**Example (Complex Task)**:
```
📋 ENHANCED PROMPT

INTENT: Optimize API performance with caching and database indexing

TECH STACK:
- Redis: Response caching
- PostgreSQL: Query optimization

CONTEXT:
- API response times >2s mentioned in previous conversation
- PostgreSQL slow query logs show N+1 problems

ACTION:
1. Profile endpoints to identify slow queries
2. Add PostgreSQL indexes on frequently queried columns
3. Implement Redis caching for read-heavy endpoints
4. Add cache invalidation on data updates

METRICS:
- Target: <500ms API response time
- Cache hit ratio: >80%

ATTENTION:
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API contracts
- Handle cache invalidation correctly to avoid stale data
```
## Workflow

```
Trigger (-e/--enhance) → Internal Analysis → Dynamic Output
         ↓                       ↓                  ↓
   User Input           Assess Task Type      Select Fields
                    Extract Memory Context    Structure Prompt
```

1. **Detect**: User input contains `-e` or `--enhance`
2. **Analyze**:
   - Determine task type (fix/optimize/implement/refactor)
   - Extract relevant session context
   - Identify tech stack and constraints
3. **Structure**:
   - Always include: INTENT + ACTION
   - Conditionally add: TECH STACK, CONTEXT, ATTENTION, METRICS, etc.
4. **Output**: Present dynamically structured prompt

## Enhancement Guidelines (Internal)

**Always Include**:
- Clear, actionable INTENT
- Concrete ACTION steps with technical details

**Add When Relevant**:
- TECH STACK: Task involves specific technologies
- CONTEXT: Session memory provides useful background
- ATTENTION: Security/compatibility/performance concerns exist
- SCOPE: Multi-module or cross-component changes
- METRICS: Performance/optimization goals need measurement
- DEPENDENCIES: Integration points matter

**Quality Checks**:
- Make vague intent explicit
- Resolve ambiguous references
- Add testing/validation steps
- Include constraints from memory

## Best Practices

- ✅ Trigger only on `-e`/`--enhance` flags
- ✅ Use **dynamic field selection** based on task type
- ✅ Extract **memory context ONLY** (no file reading)
- ✅ Always include INTENT + ACTION as core fields
- ✅ Add optional fields only when relevant to task
- ✅ Direct output (no intermediate steps shown)
- ❌ NO tool calls
- ❌ NO file operations (Bash, Read, Glob, Grep)
- ❌ NO fixed template - adapt to task needs
