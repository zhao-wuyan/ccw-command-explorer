# Dispatch Debug Tasks

Create task chains from dependency graph with proper blockedBy relationships.

## Workflow

1. Read task-analysis.json -> extract pipeline_type and dependency_graph
2. Read specs/pipelines.md -> get task registry for selected pipeline
3. Topological sort tasks (respect blockedBy)
4. Validate all owners exist in role registry (SKILL.md)
5. For each task (in order):
   - TaskCreate with structured description (see template below)
   - TaskUpdate with blockedBy + owner assignment
6. Update team-session.json with pipeline.tasks_total
7. Validate chain (no orphans, no cycles, all refs valid)

## Task Description Template

## Test Pipeline Tasks (mode: test-pipeline)

### TEST-001: Feature Testing

```
PURPOSE: Test all features from feature list and discover issues | Success: All features tested with pass/fail results
TASK:
  - Parse feature list from task description
  - For each feature: navigate to URL, explore page, generate test scenarios
  - Execute test scenarios using Chrome DevTools MCP (click, fill, hover, etc.)
  - Capture evidence: screenshots, console logs, network requests
  - Classify results: pass / fail / warning
  - Compile test report with discovered issues
CONTEXT:
  - Session: <session-folder>
  - Base URL: <base-url>
  - Features: <feature-list-from-task-analysis>
EXPECTED: <session>/artifacts/TEST-001-report.md + <session>/artifacts/TEST-001-issues.json
CONSTRAINTS: Use Chrome DevTools MCP only | Do not modify any code | Test all listed features
---
InnerLoop: true
RoleSpec: .claude/skills/team-frontend-debug/roles/tester/role.md
```

### ANALYZE-001 (Test Mode): Analyze Discovered Issues

```
PURPOSE: Analyze issues discovered by tester to identify root causes | Success: RCA for each discovered issue
TASK:
  - Load test report and issues list from TEST-001
  - For each high/medium severity issue: analyze evidence, identify root cause

TASK: <specific evidence requests from Analyzer>
CONTEXT: Session + Analyzer request
---
InnerLoop: false
RoleSpec: .claude/skills/team-frontend-debug/roles/reproducer/role.md
```

### FIX-002 (Either Mode): Re-Fix After Failed Verification

```

## Conditional Skip Rules

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| test-pipeline + TEST-001 finds 0 issues | Skip ANALYZE/FIX/VERIFY → pipeline complete |
| test-pipeline + TEST-001 finds only warnings | AskUserQuestion: fix warnings or complete |
| debug-pipeline + REPRODUCE-001 cannot reproduce | AskUserQuestion: retry with more info or abort |

## InnerLoop Flag Rules

- true: tester (iterates over features), fixer (may need multiple fix passes)
- false: reproducer, analyzer, verifier (single-pass tasks)

## Dependency Validation

- No orphan tasks (all tasks have valid owner)
- No circular dependencies
- All blockedBy references exist
- Session reference in every task description
- RoleSpec reference in every task description
