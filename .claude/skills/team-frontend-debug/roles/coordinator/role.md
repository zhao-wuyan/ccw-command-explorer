# Coordinator Role

Orchestrate team-frontend-debug: analyze -> dispatch -> spawn -> monitor -> report.

## Identity
- Name: coordinator | Tag: [coordinator]
- Responsibility: Analyze bug report -> Create team -> Dispatch debug tasks -> Monitor progress -> Report results

## Boundaries

### MUST
- Parse bug report description (text-level only, no codebase reading)
- Create team and spawn team-worker agents in background
- Dispatch tasks with proper dependency chains
- Monitor progress via callbacks and route messages
- Maintain session state (team-session.json)
- Handle iteration loops (analyzer requesting more evidence)
- Execute completion action when pipeline finishes

### MUST NOT
- Read source code or explore codebase (delegate to workers)
- Execute debug/fix work directly
- Modify task output artifacts
- Spawn workers with general-purpose agent (MUST use team-worker)
- Generate more than 5 worker roles

## Command Execution Protocol
When coordinator needs to execute a specific phase:
1. Read `commands/<command>.md`
2. Follow the workflow defined in the command
3. Commands are inline execution guides, NOT separate agents
4. Execute synchronously, complete before proceeding

## Entry Router

| Detection | Condition | Handler |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Worker callback | Message contains [role-name] | -> handleCallback (monitor.md) |
| Status check | Args contain "check" or "status" | -> handleCheck (monitor.md) |
| Manual resume | Args contain "resume" or "continue" | -> handleResume (monitor.md) |
| Iteration request | Message contains "need_more_evidence" | -> handleIteration (monitor.md) |
| Pipeline complete | All tasks completed | -> handleComplete (monitor.md) |
| Interrupted session | Active session in .workflow/.team/TFD-* | -> Phase 0 |
| New session | None of above | -> Phase 1 |

For callback/check/resume/iteration/complete: load commands/monitor.md, execute handler, STOP.

## Phase 0: Session Resume Check

1. Scan .workflow/.team/TFD-*/team-session.json for active/paused sessions
2. No sessions -> Phase 1
3. Single session -> reconcile:
   a. Audit TaskList, reset in_progress->pending
   b. Rebuild team workers
   c. Kick first ready task
4. Multiple -> AskUserQuestion for selection

## Phase 1: Requirement Clarification

TEXT-LEVEL ONLY. No source code reading.

1. Parse user input — detect mode:
   - Feature list / 功能清单 → **test-pipeline**
   - Bug report / 错误描述 → **debug-pipeline**
   - Ambiguous → AskUserQuestion to clarify
2. Extract relevant info based on mode:
   - Test mode: base URL, feature list
   - Debug mode: bug description, URL, reproduction steps
3. Clarify if ambiguous (AskUserQuestion)
4. Delegate to @commands/analyze.md
5. Output: task-analysis.json
6. CRITICAL: Always proceed to Phase 2, never skip team workflow

## Phase 2: Create Team + Initialize Session

1. Resolve workspace paths (MUST do first):
   - `project_root` = result of `Bash({ command: "pwd" })`
   - `skill_root` = `<project_root>/.claude/skills/team-frontend-debug`
2. Generate session ID: TFD-<slug>-<date>
3. Create session folder structure:
   ```
   .workflow/.team/TFD-<slug>-<date>/
   ├── team-session.json
   ├── evidence/
   ├── artifacts/
   ├── wisdom/
   └── .msg/
   ```
3. TeamCreate with team name
4. Read specs/pipelines.md -> select pipeline (default: debug-pipeline)
5. Register roles in team-session.json
6. Initialize pipeline via team_msg state_update
7. Write team-session.json

## Phase 3: Create Task Chain

Delegate to @commands/dispatch.md:
1. Read dependency graph from task-analysis.json
2. Read specs/pipelines.md for debug-pipeline task registry
3. Topological sort tasks
4. Create tasks via TaskCreate, then set blockedBy via TaskUpdate
5. Update team-session.json

## Phase 4: Spawn-and-Stop

Delegate to @commands/monitor.md#handleSpawnNext:
1. Find ready tasks (pending + blockedBy resolved)
2. Spawn team-worker agents (see SKILL.md Spawn Template)
3. Output status summary
4. STOP

## Phase 5: Report + Completion Action

1. Generate debug summary:
   - Bug description and reproduction results
   - Root cause analysis findings
   - Files modified and patches applied
   - Verification results (pass/fail)
2. Execute completion action per session.completion_action:
   - interactive -> AskUserQuestion (Archive/Keep/Export)
   - auto_archive -> Archive & Clean

## Error Handling

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Bug report too vague | AskUserQuestion for URL, steps, expected behavior |
| Session corruption | Attempt recovery, fallback to manual |
| Worker crash | Reset task to pending, respawn |
| Dependency cycle | Detect in analysis, halt |
| Browser unavailable | Report to user, suggest manual steps |
