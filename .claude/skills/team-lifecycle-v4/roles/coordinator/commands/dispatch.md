# Dispatch Tasks

Create task chains from dependency graph with proper blockedBy relationships.

## Workflow

1. Read task-analysis.json -> extract dependency_graph
2. Read specs/pipelines.md -> get task registry for selected pipeline
3. Topological sort tasks (respect blockedBy)
4. Validate all owners exist in role registry (SKILL.md)
5. For each task (in order):
   - TaskCreate with structured description (see template below)
   - TaskUpdate with blockedBy + owner assignment
6. Update team-session.json with pipeline.tasks_total
7. Validate chain (no orphans, no cycles, all refs valid)

## Task Description Template

```
PURPOSE: <goal> | Success: <criteria>
TASK:
  - <step 1>
  - <step 2>
CONTEXT:
  - Session: <session-folder>
  - Upstream artifacts: <list>
  - Key files: <list>
EXPECTED: <artifact path> + <quality criteria>
CONSTRAINTS: <scope limits>
---
InnerLoop: <true|false>
RoleSpec: ~  or <project>/.claude/skills/team-lifecycle-v4/roles/<role>/role.md
```

## InnerLoop Flag Rules

- true: Role has 2+ serial same-prefix tasks (writer: DRAFT-001->004) where each blockedBy the previous
- false: Role has 1 task, or tasks are parallel (no mutual blockedBy)

### Parallel Detection for IMPL Tasks

When creating IMPL-{1..N} tasks from PLAN-001 output:

1. Read plan.json → extract `tasks[]` with their `depends_on` fields
2. Build dependency graph among IMPL tasks only
3. Classify:
   - **Serial chain**: IMPL-002 blockedBy IMPL-001 → both get `InnerLoop: true`, single worker
   - **Parallel set**: IMPL-001..N all blockedBy PLAN-001 only (no mutual deps) → each gets `InnerLoop: false`, separate workers
   - **Mixed DAG**: Some parallel, some serial → group into independent chains, each chain gets one worker with `InnerLoop: true`; independent chains spawn in parallel
4. Set `InnerLoop` in each task description accordingly

## CHECKPOINT Task Rules

CHECKPOINT tasks are dispatched like regular tasks but handled differently at spawn time:

- Created via TaskCreate with proper blockedBy (upstream tasks that must complete first)
- Owner: supervisor
- **NOT spawned as team-worker** — coordinator wakes the resident supervisor via SendMessage
- If `supervision: false` in team-session.json, skip creating CHECKPOINT tasks entirely
- RoleSpec in description: `~  or <project>/.claude/skills/team-lifecycle-v4/roles/supervisor/role.md`

## Dependency Validation

- No orphan tasks (all tasks have valid owner)
- No circular dependencies
- All blockedBy references exist
- Session reference in every task description
- RoleSpec reference in every task description
