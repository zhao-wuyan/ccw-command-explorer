# Monitor Pipeline

Event-driven pipeline coordination. Beat model: coordinator wake -> process -> spawn -> STOP.

## Constants

- SPAWN_MODE: background
- ONE_STEP_PER_INVOCATION: true
- FAST_ADVANCE_AWARE: true
- WORKER_AGENT: team-worker
- SUPERVISOR_AGENT: team-supervisor (resident, woken via SendMessage)

## Handler Router

| Source | Handler |
|--------|---------|
| Message contains [role-name] | handleCallback |
| "capability_gap" | handleAdapt |
| "check" or "status" | handleCheck |
| "resume" or "continue" | handleResume |
| All tasks completed | handleComplete |
| Default | handleSpawnNext |

## handleCallback

Worker completed. Process and advance.

1. Find matching worker by role in message
2. Check if progress update (inner loop) or final completion
3. Progress -> update session state, STOP
4. Completion -> mark task done
   - Resident agent (supervisor) -> keep in active_workers (stays alive for future checkpoints)
   - Standard worker -> remove from active_workers
5. Check for checkpoints:
   - CHECKPOINT-* with verdict "block" -> AskUserQuestion: Override / Revise upstream / Abort
   - CHECKPOINT-* with verdict "warn" -> log risks to wisdom, proceed normally
   - CHECKPOINT-* with verdict "pass" -> proceed normally
   - QUALITY-001 -> display quality gate, pause for user commands
   - PLAN-001 -> dynamicImplDispatch (see below)
6. -> handleSpawnNext

### dynamicImplDispatch (PLAN-001 callback)

When PLAN-001 completes, coordinator creates IMPL tasks based on complexity:

1. Read `<session>/plan/plan.json` → extract `complexity`, `tasks[]`
2. Route by complexity (per specs/pipelines.md §6):

| Complexity | Action |
|------------|--------|
| Low (1-2 modules) | Create single IMPL-001, blockedBy: [PLAN-001], InnerLoop: true |
| Medium (3-4 modules) | Create IMPL-{1..N}, each blockedBy: [PLAN-001] only, InnerLoop: false |
| High (5+ modules) | Create IMPL-{1..N} with DAG deps from plan.json, InnerLoop per dispatch rules |

3. For each IMPL task: TaskCreate with structured description (dispatch.md template)
4. Set blockedBy:
   - **Parallel tasks**: blockedBy: [PLAN-001] (or [CHECKPOINT-003] if supervision enabled)
   - **Serial chain within DAG**: blockedBy includes upstream IMPL task IDs
5. Update team-session.json: `pipeline.tasks_total`, `pipeline.impl_topology: "single"|"parallel"|"dag"`
6. Log via team_msg: `{ type: "state_update", data: { impl_count: N, topology: "..." } }`

## handleCheck

Read-only status report, then STOP.

Output:
```
[coordinator] Pipeline Status
[coordinator] Progress: <done>/<total> (<pct>%)
[coordinator] Active: <workers with elapsed time>
[coordinator] Ready: <pending tasks with resolved deps>
[coordinator] Commands: 'resume' to advance | 'check' to refresh
```

## handleResume

1. No active workers -> handleSpawnNext
2. Has active -> check each status
   - completed -> mark done
   - in_progress -> still running
   - Resident agent (supervisor) with `resident: true` + no CHECKPOINT in_progress + pending CHECKPOINT exists
     -> supervisor may have crashed. Respawn with `recovery: true`
3. Some completed -> handleSpawnNext
4. All running -> report status, STOP

## handleSpawnNext

Find ready tasks, spawn workers, STOP.

1. Collect: completedSubjects, inProgressSubjects, readySubjects
2. No ready + work in progress -> report waiting, STOP
3. No ready + nothing in progress -> handleComplete
4. Has ready -> for each:
   a. Check inner_loop: parse task description `InnerLoop:` field (NOT role.md default)
      - InnerLoop: true AND same-role worker already active -> skip (worker picks up next task)
      - InnerLoop: false OR no active same-role worker -> spawn new worker
   b. **CHECKPOINT-* task** -> wake resident supervisor (see below)
   c. Other tasks -> standard spawn:
      - TaskUpdate -> in_progress
      - team_msg log -> task_unblocked
      - Spawn team-worker (see SKILL.md Worker Spawn Template)
      - Add to active_workers
5. Update session, output summary, STOP

### Wake Supervisor for CHECKPOINT

When a ready task has prefix `CHECKPOINT-*`:

1. Verify supervisor is in active_workers with `resident: true`
   - Not found -> spawn supervisor using SKILL.md Supervisor Spawn Template, wait for ready callback, then wake
2. Determine scope: list task IDs that this checkpoint depends on (its blockedBy tasks)
3. SendMessage to supervisor (see SKILL.md Supervisor Wake Template):
   ```
   SendMessage({
     type: "message",
     recipient: "supervisor",
     content: "## Checkpoint Request\ntask_id: <CHECKPOINT-NNN>\nscope: [<upstream-task-ids>]\npipeline_progress: <done>/<total> tasks completed",
     summary: "Checkpoint request: <CHECKPOINT-NNN>"
   })
   ```
4. Do NOT TaskUpdate in_progress — supervisor claims the task itself
5. Do NOT add duplicate entry to active_workers (supervisor already tracked)

## handleComplete

Pipeline done. Generate report and completion action.

1. Shutdown resident supervisor (if active):
   ```
   SendMessage({ to: "supervisor", message: { type: "shutdown_request", reason: "Pipeline complete" } })
   ```
2. Generate summary (deliverables, stats, discussions)
3. Read session.completion_action:
   - interactive -> AskUserQuestion (Archive/Keep/Export)
   - auto_archive -> Archive & Clean (status=completed, TeamDelete)
   - auto_keep -> Keep Active (status=paused)

## handleAdapt

Capability gap reported mid-pipeline.

1. Parse gap description
2. Check if existing role covers it -> redirect
3. Role count < 5 -> generate dynamic role-spec in <session>/role-specs/
4. Create new task, spawn worker
5. Role count >= 5 -> merge or pause

## Fast-Advance Reconciliation

On every coordinator wake:
1. Read team_msg entries with type="fast_advance"
2. Sync active_workers with spawned successors
3. No duplicate spawns
