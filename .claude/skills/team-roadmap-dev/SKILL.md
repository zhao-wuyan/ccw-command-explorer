# Team Roadmap Dev

Roadmap-driven development with phased execution pipeline. Coordinator discusses roadmap with the user and manages phase transitions. Workers are spawned as team-worker agents.

## Architecture

```
Skill(skill="team-roadmap-dev", args="<task-description>")
                    |
         SKILL.md (this file) = Router
                    |
     +--------------+--------------+
     |                             |
  no --role flag              --role <name>
     |                             |
  Coordinator                  Worker
  roles/coordinator/role.md    roles/<name>/role.md
     |
     +-- roadmap-discuss -> dispatch -> spawn workers -> STOP
                                    |
                    +-------+-------+-------+
                    v       v       v
                 [planner] [executor] [verifier]
                 (team-worker agents)

Pipeline (per phase):
  PLAN-N01 -> EXEC-N01 -> VERIFY-N01 (gap closure loop if needed)

Multi-phase:
  Phase 1 -> Phase 2 -> ... -> Phase N -> Complete
```

## Role Registry

| Role | Path | Prefix | Inner Loop |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| coordinator | [roles/coordinator/role.md](roles/coordinator/role.md) | — | — |
| planner | [roles/planner/role.md](roles/planner/role.md) | PLAN-* | true |
| executor | [roles/executor/role.md](roles/executor/role.md) | EXEC-* | true |
| verifier | [roles/verifier/role.md](roles/verifier/role.md) | VERIFY-* | true |

## Role Router

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- Has `--role <name>` → Read `roles/<name>/role.md`, execute Phase 2-4
- No `--role` → Read `roles/coordinator/role.md`, execute entry router

## Shared Constants

- **Session prefix**: `RD`
- **Session path**: `.workflow/.team/RD-<slug>-<date>/`
- **Team name**: `roadmap-dev`
- **CLI tools**: `ccw cli --mode analysis` (read-only), `ccw cli --mode write` (modifications)
- **Message bus**: `mcp__ccw-tools__team_msg(session_id=<session-id>, ...)`

## Worker Spawn Template

Coordinator spawns workers using this template:

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "team-worker",
  description: "Spawn <role> worker",
  team_name: "roadmap-dev",
  name: "<role>",
  run_in_background: true,
  prompt: `## Role Assignment
role: <role>
role_spec: ~  or <project>/.claude/skills/team-roadmap-dev/roles/<role>/role.md
session: <session-folder>
session_id: <session-id>
team_name: roadmap-dev
requirement: <task-description>
inner_loop: true

Read role_spec file to load Phase 2-4 domain instructions.
Execute built-in Phase 1 (task discovery) -> role Phase 2-4 -> built-in Phase 5 (report).`
})
```

**All worker roles** (planner, executor, verifier): Set `inner_loop: true`.

## User Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `check` / `status` | Output execution status graph (phase-grouped), no advancement |
| `resume` / `continue` | Check worker states, advance next step |

## Session Directory

```
.workflow/.team/RD-<slug>-<date>/
+-- roadmap.md                 # Phase plan with requirements and success criteria
+-- state.md                   # Living memory (<100 lines)
+-- config.json                # Session settings (mode, depth, gates)
+-- wisdom/                    # Cross-task knowledge accumulation
|   +-- learnings.md
|   +-- decisions.md

    +-- messages.jsonl          # Team message bus log
    +-- meta.json               # Session metadata + shared state
```

## Completion Action

When the pipeline completes:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Roadmap Dev pipeline complete. What would you like to do?",
    header: "Completion",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Archive & Clean (Recommended)", description: "Archive session, clean up tasks and team resources" },
      { label: "Keep Active", description: "Keep session active for follow-up work or inspection" },
      { label: "Export Results", description: "Export deliverables to a specified location, then clean" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Unknown --role value | Error with role registry list |
| Role file not found | Error with expected path (roles/{name}/role.md) |
| project-tech.json missing | Coordinator invokes /workflow:spec:setup  |
| Phase verification fails with gaps | Coordinator triggers gap closure loop (max 3 iterations) |
| Max gap closure iterations (3) | Report to user, ask for guidance |
| Worker crash | Respawn worker, reassign task |
| Session corruption | Attempt recovery, fallback to manual reconciliation |
