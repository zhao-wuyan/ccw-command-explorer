# Dispatch Command

## Purpose

Create task chains based on execution mode. Generate structured task descriptions with PURPOSE/TASK/CONTEXT/EXPECTED/CONSTRAINTS format.

---

## Phase 2: Context Loading

| Input | Source | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Session ID | coordinator Phase 2 | Yes |
| Project path | coordinator Phase 1 | Yes |
| Framework | coordinator Phase 1 | Yes |
| Pipeline mode | meta.json | Yes |

1. Load session ID from coordinator context
2. Load project path and framework from meta.json
3. Determine pipeline mode (standard)

## Phase 3: Task Chain Creation

### Task Description Template

Every task description uses structured format for clarity:

```
TaskCreate({
  subject: "<TASK-ID>",
  description: "PURPOSE: <what this task achieves> | Success: <measurable completion criteria>
TASK:
  - <step 1: specific action>
  - <step 2: specific action>
  - <step 3: specific action>
CONTEXT:
  - Session: <session-folder>
  - Scope: <scope>
  - Upstream artifacts: <artifact-1.md>, <artifact-2.md>
  - Key files: <file1>, <file2> (if applicable)
  - State: via team_msg(operation="get_state", role=<upstream-role>)
EXPECTED: <deliverable path> + <quality criteria>
CONSTRAINTS: <scope limits, focus areas>
---
InnerLoop: <true|false>
<additional-metadata-fields>"
})
TaskUpdate({ taskId: "<TASK-ID>", addBlockedBy: [<dependency-list>], owner: "<role>" })
```

### Standard Pipeline Tasks

  description: "PURPOSE: Design feedback mechanisms and state management solutions for identified issues | Success: Complete implementation guide with code patterns and examples
TASK:
  - Load diagnosis report from artifacts/diagnosis.md
  - Design feedback mechanisms (loading/error/success states) for each issue
  - Design state management patterns (useState/ref, reactive updates)
  - Design input control improvements (file selectors, validation)
  - Generate framework-specific code patterns (React/Vue)

  - Extract implementation tasks from design guide
  - Generate fix code with proper state management (useState/ref)

TaskUpdate({ taskId: "TEST-001", addBlockedBy: ["IMPL-001"], owner: "tester" })
```

## Phase 4: Validation

1. Verify all tasks created successfully
2. Check task dependency chain is valid (no cycles)
3. Verify all task owners match Role Registry
4. Confirm task prefixes match role frontmatter
5. Output task count and dependency graph

| Check | Pass Criteria |
|-------|---------------|
| Task count | 5 tasks created |
| Dependencies | Linear chain: SCAN → DIAG → DESIGN → IMPL → TEST |
| Owners | All owners in Role Registry |
| Prefixes | Match role frontmatter |
