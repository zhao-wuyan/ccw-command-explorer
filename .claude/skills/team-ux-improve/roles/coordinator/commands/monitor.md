# Monitor Pipeline

Event-driven pipeline coordination. Beat model: coordinator wake -> process -> spawn -> STOP.

## Constants

- SPAWN_MODE: background
- ONE_STEP_PER_INVOCATION: true
- FAST_ADVANCE_AWARE: true
- WORKER_AGENT: team-worker
- MAX_TEST_ITERATIONS: 5

## Handler Router

| Source | Handler |
|--------|---------|
| Message contains [scanner], [diagnoser], [designer], [implementer], [tester] | handleCallback |
| "capability_gap" | handleAdapt |
| "check" or "status" | handleCheck |
| "resume" or "continue" | handleResume |
| All tasks completed | handleComplete |
| Default | handleSpawnNext |

## handleCallback

Worker completed. Process and advance.

1. Parse message to identify role and task ID:

| Message Pattern | Role |
|----------------|------|
| `[scanner]` or `SCAN-*` | scanner |
| `[diagnoser]` or `DIAG-*` | diagnoser |
| `[designer]` or `DESIGN-*` | designer |
| `[implementer]` or `IMPL-*` | implementer |
| `[tester]` or `TEST-*` | tester |

2. Check if progress update (inner loop) or final completion
3. Progress update -> update session state, STOP
4. Completion -> mark task done:
   ```
   TaskUpdate({ taskId: "<task-id>", status: "completed" })
   ```
5. Remove from active_workers, record completion in session

6. Check for checkpoints:
   - **TEST-001 completes** -> Validation Gate:
     Read test results from `.msg/meta.json`

     | Condition | Action |
     |-----------|--------|
     | pass_rate >= 95% | -> handleSpawnNext (pipeline likely complete) |
     | pass_rate < 95% AND iterations < max | Log warning, still -> handleSpawnNext |
     | pass_rate < 95% AND iterations >= max | Accept current state -> handleComplete |

7. -> handleSpawnNext

## handleCheck

Read-only status report, then STOP.

```
Pipeline Status (standard):
  [DONE]  SCAN-001    (scanner)     -> artifacts/scan-report.md
  [DONE]  DIAG-001    (diagnoser)   -> artifacts/diagnosis.md
  [RUN]   DESIGN-001  (designer)    -> designing solutions...
  [WAIT]  IMPL-001    (implementer) -> blocked by DESIGN-001
  [WAIT]  TEST-001    (tester)      -> blocked by IMPL-001

Session: <session-id>
Commands: 'resume' to advance | 'check' to refresh
```

Output status -- do NOT advance pipeline.

## handleResume

1. Audit task list for inconsistencies:
   - Tasks stuck in "in_progress" -> reset to "pending"
   - Tasks with completed blockers but still "pending" -> include in spawn list
2. -> handleSpawnNext

## handleSpawnNext

Find ready tasks, spawn workers, STOP.

1. Collect: completedSubjects, inProgressSubjects, readySubjects (pending + all blockedBy completed)
2. No ready + work in progress -> report waiting, STOP
3. No ready + nothing in progress -> handleComplete
4. Has ready -> for each:
   a. Check inner loop role with active worker -> skip (worker picks up)
   b. TaskUpdate -> in_progress
   c. team_msg log -> task_unblocked
   d. Spawn team-worker:

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "team-worker",
  description: "Spawn <role> worker for <task-id>",
  team_name: "ux-improve",
  name: "<role>",
  run_in_background: true,
  prompt: `## Role Assignment
role: <role>
role_spec: .claude/skills/team-ux-improve/roles/<role>/role.md
session: <session-folder>
session_id: <session-id>
team_name: ux-improve
requirement: <task-description>
inner_loop: <true|false>

Read role_spec file to load Phase 2-4 domain instructions.
Execute built-in Phase 1 (task discovery) -> role Phase 2-4 -> built-in Phase 5 (report).`
})
```

Stage-to-role mapping:
| Task Prefix | Role |
|-------------|------|
| SCAN | scanner |
| DIAG | diagnoser |
| DESIGN | designer |
| IMPL | implementer |
| TEST | tester |

Inner loop roles: implementer (inner_loop: true)
Single-task roles: scanner, diagnoser, designer, tester (inner_loop: false)

5. Add to active_workers, update session, output summary, STOP

## handleComplete

Pipeline done. Generate report and completion action.

1. Verify all tasks (including any fix-verify iterations) have status "completed"
2. If any tasks not completed -> handleSpawnNext
3. If all completed -> transition to coordinator Phase 5

## handleAdapt

Capability gap reported mid-pipeline.

1. Parse gap description
2. Check if existing role covers it -> redirect
3. Role count < 5 -> generate dynamic role spec
4. Create new task, spawn worker
5. Role count >= 5 -> merge or pause

## Fast-Advance Reconciliation

On every coordinator wake:
1. Read team_msg entries with type="fast_advance"
2. Sync active_workers with spawned successors
3. No duplicate spawns
