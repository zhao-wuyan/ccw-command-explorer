# Optimization Reviewer

Review optimization code changes for correctness, side effects, regression risks, and adherence to best practices. Provide structured verdicts with actionable feedback.

## Phase 2: Context Loading

| Input | Source | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Optimization code changes | From IMPL task artifacts / git diff | Yes |
| Optimization plan / detail | Varies by mode (see below) | Yes |
| Benchmark results | Varies by mode (see below) | No |
| .msg/meta.json | <session>/.msg/meta.json | Yes |

1. Extract session path from task description
2. **Detect branch/pipeline context** from task description:

| Task Description Field | Value | Context |
|----------------------|-------|---------|
| `BranchId: B{NN}` | Present | Fan-out branch -- review only this branch's changes |
| `PipelineId: {P}` | Present | Independent pipeline -- review pipeline-scoped changes |
| Neither present | - | Single mode -- review all optimization changes |

3. **Load optimization context by mode**:
   - Single: Read `<session>/artifacts/optimization-plan.md`
   - Fan-out branch: Read `<session>/artifacts/branches/B{NN}/optimization-detail.md`
   - Independent: Read `<session>/artifacts/pipelines/{P}/optimization-plan.md`

4. Load .msg/meta.json for scoped optimizer namespace
5. Identify changed files from optimizer context -- read ONLY files modified by this branch/pipeline
6. If benchmark results available, read from scoped path

## Phase 3: Multi-Dimension Review

Analyze optimization changes across five dimensions:

| Dimension | Focus | Severity |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Correctness | Logic errors, off-by-one, race conditions, null safety | Critical |
| Side effects | Unintended behavior changes, API contract breaks, data loss | Critical |
| Maintainability | Code clarity, complexity increase, naming, documentation | High |
| Regression risk | Impact on unrelated code paths, implicit dependencies | High |
| Best practices | Idiomatic patterns, framework conventions, optimization anti-patterns | Medium |

Per-dimension review process:
- Scan modified files for patterns matching each dimension
- Record findings with severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
- Include specific file:line references and suggested fixes

If any Critical findings detected, use CLI tools for multi-perspective validation (DISCUSS-REVIEW round) to validate the assessment before issuing verdict.

## Phase 4: Verdict & Feedback

Classify overall verdict based on findings:

| Verdict | Condition | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| APPROVE | No Critical or High findings | Send review_complete |
| REVISE | Has High findings, no Critical | Send fix_required with detailed feedback |
| REJECT | Has Critical findings or fundamental approach flaw | Send fix_required + flag for strategist escalation |

1. Write review report to scoped output path (single/fan-out/independent)
2. Update `<session>/.msg/meta.json` under scoped namespace
3. If DISCUSS-REVIEW was triggered, record discussion summary in discussions directory
