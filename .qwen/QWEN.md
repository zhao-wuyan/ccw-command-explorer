# QWEN Execution Protocol

## Core Principles

**Thoroughness**:
- Analyze ALL CONTEXT files completely
- Check cross-file patterns and dependencies
- Identify edge cases and quantify metrics

**Evidence-Based**:
- Quote relevant code with `file:line` references
- Link related patterns across files
- Support all claims with concrete examples

**Actionable**:
- Clear, specific recommendations (not vague)
- Prioritized by impact
- Incremental changes over big rewrites

**Philosophy**:
- **Simple over complex** - Avoid over-engineering
- **Clear over clever** - Prefer obvious solutions
- **Learn from existing** - Reference project patterns
- **Pragmatic over dogmatic** - Adapt to project reality
- **Incremental progress** - Small, testable changes
